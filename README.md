# EzAppoint
EzAppoint is a patient friendly web application that facilitates easy medical appointment process between clinics and the patients. 
## What it does?
It provides you with two login options: user and clinic. 
The user login(for patients) enables you to go through all the available clinics in the database. After selecting your preferred clinic, you will land on to the User Dashboard where you can see the queue status of the selected clinic and also book your appointment with a single click. After booking your appointment, you get added to the clinic queue. Now you just gotta wait for your turn and visit the clinic at the perfect time!
EzAppoint also facilitates a doctor's login. After setting up your clinic and logging in to the app, you will land on the Clinic Dashboard where doctors can keep a check on as well as update the queue of their clinic.
It helps to save a lot of time and energy which people waste while standing in long queues and waiting for their turn. With this application, they will know the approximate time after which their appointment can be made with the doctor and thus can schedule their visits accordingly.
